# Kan Ban Boards
this is a project that where i used the DNDKit to make a drag and drop kan ban board. i have never created a drag an drop functionality before but the documentation for dndKit is  very simple to understand walks you through the basics of drag and dropping.
## Problems faced
1. the projects initially asked for the drag and drop to be done by react-beautify-dnd which is now a depreciated package and i found it quite complex to go through their documentation 
2. Event Bubbling: there were many parts where the events were being bubbled to the parents.
## What could be improved.
1. the no of drop zones could be customized by the user / let the user create the dropzones. i didnt implement this because i had created the types already for a todo doing and completed.
2. testing: i am a complete beginner and testing and unfortunately i couldnt add testing to this project.
