# Task 1 

## Tools Used
<b>HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, Swiper.js</b>

<p>
  the product was created by the help of swiper.js a library that is used to create sliders. 
  for this project i used the coverflow effect. this same effect could be achived by the help of event listeners but that would increase the complexity of the project.
  so i used the slider.js library 
</p>

<strong>setup instructions<strong> i performed
1. create a index.html 
2. set the CDN for cloudflare
3. create styles.css 
4. created the card components and made responsive

#### why i used swiper.js 
swiper.js is a simple lightweight sliding library for creating sliders. without slider.js it would be complicated to create sliders which involved grabbing because we would have to get the clients mouse positions make collision detections which would be incredibly mathematically challenging to finish in the time limit.

Limitations & trade offs
1. this project is highly depended upon slider.js which is a third party library any changes to the actual codebase of swiper.js could break the system and would require to make updates on the project if a newer version of slider.js comes
2. platform dependent
