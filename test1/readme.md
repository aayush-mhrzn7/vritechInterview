# Task 1 

## Tools Used
<b>HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, Swiper</b>

<p>
  the product was created by the help of swiper.js a library that is used to create sliders. 
  for this project i used the coverflow effect. this same effect could be achived by the help of event listeners but that would increase the complexity of the project.
  so i used the slider.js library
